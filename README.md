# Rock Paper and Scissors
A game of rock, paper, and scissors developed in Angular.io and Node.JS/Express

* * *

## Requirements
- Node.JS
- MongoDB

## How to use

Execute the following command in the terminal:

```SH
$ npm install # Installs all the app's dependencies
$ npm start   # Runs the app's host
```

Once once `npm start` is executed, the host will be listening on the address `http://localhost:8080`

**NOTE:** If for some reason the host fails start, this might due to port being in used, for changing the port just edit the `config.json` file for the `port` value in `server`, once the new value is set try again.

Also, make sure that the mongoDB server is properly running at the localhost.
